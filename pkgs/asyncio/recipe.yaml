  summary: Reference implementation of PEP 3156
  description: |
    This is a proposal for asynchronous I/O in Python 3, starting at Python 3.3. 
    Consider this the concrete proposal that is missing from PEP 3153. 
    The proposal includes a pluggable event loop, transport and protocol abstractions similar to those in Twisted, 
    and a higher-level scheduler based on yield from (PEP 380). 
    The proposed package name is asyncio.
