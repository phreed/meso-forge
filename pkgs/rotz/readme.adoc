== Features

* **Cross-platform support** - Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows
* **Multiple configuration formats** - Supports YAML, TOML, and JSON
* **Handlebars templating** - Dynamic configuration with template support
* **Environment bootstrapping** - Install applications and tools automatically
* **Symlink management** - Intelligent linking of dotfiles to their destinations
* **Git integration** - Clone and manage dotfile repositories
* **Shell completion** - Built-in completion for bash, fish, and zsh

== Main Functionalities

1. **Linking dotfiles** from a common repository to your system
2. **Installing applications** you need to start working on a new/empty machine
3. **Full cross-platform** functionality across different operating systems

== Usage

=== Basic Commands

Initialize a new dotfiles repository:
```bash
rotz init
```

Clone an existing dotfiles repository:
```bash
rotz clone git@github.com:<user>/<repo>.git
```

Link your dotfiles:
```bash
rotz link
```

Install applications and dependencies:
```bash
rotz install
```

=== Configuration

Rotz uses configuration files in YAML, TOML, or JSON format. The tool will auto-detect the correct file type based on the file extension.

Example configuration structure:
```yaml
# rotz.yaml
dots:
  - link: ~/.bashrc
    from: bashrc
  - link: ~/.vimrc
    from: vimrc

installs:
  - name: git
    type: package
  - name: vim
    type: package
```

=== Template Support

Rotz supports Handlebars templating for dynamic configuration:

```yaml
# Use system information in your configs
dots:
  - link: ~/.config/app/config.json
    from: config.json.hbs
    template: true
```

Template variables available:
* `{{os}}` - Operating system
* `{{arch}}` - System architecture
* `{{user}}` - Current username
* `{{home}}` - Home directory path
