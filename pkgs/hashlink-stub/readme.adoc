= HashLink Stub Package

This package provides a lightweight placeholder for https://hashlink.haxe.org/[HashLink], the virtual machine for Haxe applications.

== About This Package

*hashlink-stub* is a minimal placeholder package that provides basic command-line tools to inform users about the availability of the full HashLink package. This stub allows for immediate installation and testing while the complete HashLink implementation is being developed.

**Current Version**: 1.14 +
**Package Size**: ~4.0 KiB +
**Status**: âœ… Successfully deployed to production

== About HashLink

HashLink is a cross-platform virtual machine designed to run Haxe applications. It provides:

* High-performance execution of Haxe bytecode
* Just-in-time (JIT) compilation for optimal performance
* Native debugging support
* Cross-platform compatibility (Linux, macOS, Windows)
* Integration with graphics and multimedia libraries

HashLink is often used as an alternative to compiling Haxe to native C++ for applications that need high performance but want to maintain cross-platform compatibility.

== What's Included

This stub package includes:

* `hl` - Stub HashLink virtual machine executable with version information
* Basic library directory structure under `lib/`
* Installation verification tools
* Runtime information display

== Installation

Add the meso-forge channel and install the package:

[source,bash]
----
# Add the meso-forge channel
conda config --add channels https://prefix.dev/meso-forge

# Install HashLink stub
conda install hashlink-stub

# Or install with Haxe stub
conda install haxe-stub hashlink-stub
----

== Usage

After installation, you can verify the stub is working:

[source,bash]
----
# Check HashLink stub version
hl

# The stub will display version information and guidance
----

The stub binary will display version information and guidance for installing the full package.

== Architecture Support

Current platform support:
* linux-64

Planned platform support:
* linux-aarch64
* osx-arm64
* osx-64
* win-64

== Migration Path

When the full HashLink package becomes available:

1. The stub will be deprecated with clear migration instructions
2. Users can seamlessly upgrade to the full package
3. All stub functionality will be replaced by complete implementations
4. Binary compatibility will be maintained for existing Haxe applications

== Future Development

=== Planned Features
* Complete virtual machine implementation
* Full graphics and multimedia library support
* Advanced debugging and profiling tools
* Performance optimizations
* Native extension support

=== Development Phases
* **Current**: Stub package available for immediate use
* **Phase 1**: Core VM implementation with basic libraries
* **Phase 2**: Full multimedia and graphics support
* **Phase 3**: Advanced debugging and profiling tools
* **Future**: Multi-platform releases and performance optimizations

== Debugging Support

The full HashLink package will support native debugging through:

* Visual Studio Code (with HashLink debugger extension)
* Command-line debugging tools
* Memory and performance profilers
* Runtime inspection capabilities

== Dependencies

The full package will include support for:

* **Graphics**: SDL2, OpenGL
* **Audio**: OpenAL
* **Image formats**: PNG, JPEG
* **Networking**: libuv
* **Database**: SQLite
* **Compression**: zlib
* **Security**: mbedTLS

== Troubleshooting

=== Common Issues
* **Command not found**: Ensure the meso-forge channel is added and package is installed
* **Permission errors**: Check that the conda environment has proper permissions
* **Version conflicts**: Use `conda list hashlink-stub` to verify installation

=== Performance Notes
* The stub provides minimal functionality for testing
* Full performance capabilities require the complete HashLink package
* Runtime performance will be significantly improved in the full implementation
