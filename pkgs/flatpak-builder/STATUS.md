# Flatpak-Builder Package Status

## Current State: INCOMPLETE - Dependencies Missing

### Package Information
- **Package Name:** flatpak-builder
- **Version:** 1.4.4
- **Source:** https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak-builder/releases/download/1.4.4/flatpak-builder-1.4.4.tar.xz
- **License:** LGPL-2.1-or-later
- **Build System:** Meson/Ninja

### Files Created
1. ✅ `recipe.yaml` - Main conda recipe (with limitations)
2. ✅ `readme.adoc` - Documentation with dependency warnings
3. ✅ `missing-licenses.yaml` - License tracking file
4. ✅ `TASK_LIST.md` - Comprehensive task list for completion
5. ✅ `STATUS.md` - This status file

### Major Blockers

#### Missing Critical Dependencies (Not in conda-forge)
1. **ostree (>=2017.14)** - Core Flatpak dependency for filesystem management
   - Status: ❌ Not available in conda-forge
   - Impact: Without this, flatpak-builder cannot function at all
   - Required for: Core Flatpak operations, repository management

2. **debugedit (>=5.0)** - Build-time dependency for debug info processing
   - Status: ❌ Not available in conda-forge
   - Impact: Build will fail during meson configuration
   - Required for: Processing debug information in built packages

3. **appstream (>=0.15.0)** - Metadata validation tool
   - Status: ❌ Not available in conda-forge
   - Impact: Cannot validate app metadata, compose operations fail
   - Required for: AppStream metadata processing and validation

### Available Dependencies (In conda-forge)
- ✅ glib (>=2.66)
- ✅ json-glib
- ✅ libcurl
- ✅ elfutils (>=0.8.12) - provides libelf
- ✅ libxml2 (>=2.4)
- ✅ yaml
- ✅ meson, ninja, pkg-config, gcc

### Current Recipe Limitations

1. **Build Will Fail:** The meson configuration will fail when it cannot find ostree, debugedit, and appstream
2. **Functionality Limited:** Even if built, the resulting binary would be non-functional without system dependencies
3. **System Dependencies Required:** Users must install missing deps via system package manager
4. **Warning Messages:** Recipe includes warnings about limitations

### Build Script Approach
The current recipe attempts to:
- Check for system-installed ostree during build
- Exit with helpful error messages if dependencies missing
- Provide installation instructions for major Linux distributions
- Build with available dependencies only

### Recommended Next Steps

#### Immediate (High Priority)
1. Create ostree package - highest impact dependency
2. Create debugedit package - required for build to succeed
3. Create appstream package - needed for full functionality

#### Short Term
1. Test build process with system-provided dependencies
2. Improve error handling and user guidance
3. Add comprehensive test suite

#### Long Term
1. Consider containerized solution as alternative
2. Implement system integration wrapper approach
3. Add automated update mechanisms

### Alternative Approaches Considered

1. **System Wrapper:** Package that wraps system-installed flatpak-builder
   - Pros: Avoids dependency issues
   - Cons: Less portable, conda environment integration limited

2. **Container Solution:** Docker/Podman container with all dependencies
   - Pros: Complete isolation, all deps included
   - Cons: Complex integration, resource overhead

3. **Partial Build:** Build what's possible, document limitations
   - Pros: Quick start, educational value
   - Cons: Non-functional result, user confusion

### User Impact
- ❌ Package cannot be used out-of-the-box
- ❌ Requires significant system-level setup
- ❌ May confuse users expecting conda-style isolation
- ✅ Provides clear documentation of issues
- ✅ Offers installation guidance for system dependencies

### Conclusion
This package demonstrates the challenge of packaging complex system tools with deep OS integration requirements in conda-forge. The missing dependencies (ostree, debugedit, appstream) are fundamental to Flatpak's operation and would need to be packaged first before flatpak-builder can be functional.

The created recipe serves as a foundation and documents the requirements clearly, but significant additional work is needed to create a fully functional package.
