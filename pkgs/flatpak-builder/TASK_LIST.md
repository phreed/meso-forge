# Flatpak-Builder Package Completion Task List

This document contains LLM prompts for completing the flatpak-builder package and addressing its dependencies. Each task is phrased as a prompt that can be used with an LLM to continue development.

## Core Dependency Tasks

### 1. Create OSTree Package
**Prompt:** "Create a conda-forge recipe for OSTree (libostree) version 2017.14 or later. OSTree is a tool for managing bootable, immutable, versioned filesystem trees. The source code is available at https://github.com/ostreedev/ostree. The package requires dependencies like glib, libsoup, gpgme, and fuse. Include proper build configuration for meson build system and ensure all required libraries are linked correctly."

### 2. Create DebugEdit Package  
**Prompt:** "Create a conda-forge recipe for debugedit version 5.0 or later. DebugEdit provides programs and scripts for creating debuginfo and source file distributions. The source is available at https://sourceware.org/debugedit/. It depends on elfutils libelf and libdw libraries. Configure the build to include all necessary tools for DWARF debug data manipulation."

### 3. Create AppStream Package
**Prompt:** "Create a conda-forge recipe for AppStream version 0.15.0 or later. AppStream provides a standard for creating app stores and software component metadata. The source is available at https://github.com/ximion/appstream. It requires dependencies like glib, libxml2, libcurl, and libyaml. Include the appstreamcli command-line tool and compose plugin that flatpak-builder requires."

## Build System Improvements

### 4. Enhance Meson Configuration
**Prompt:** "Improve the flatpak-builder recipe's meson configuration to handle optional dependencies gracefully. Add feature detection for missing system dependencies and configure build options to disable features when dependencies are unavailable. Ensure the build can proceed with degraded functionality rather than failing completely."

### 5. Add Dependency Validation Script
**Prompt:** "Create a post-install validation script for the flatpak-builder package that checks for required system dependencies and provides helpful error messages with installation instructions for different Linux distributions. The script should verify the presence and versions of ostree, debugedit, and appstream tools."

## Testing and Quality Assurance

### 6. Create Comprehensive Test Suite
**Prompt:** "Design a comprehensive test suite for the flatpak-builder package that includes: 1) Unit tests for basic functionality, 2) Integration tests with simple manifest files, 3) Dependency validation tests, 4) Cross-platform compatibility tests for different Linux distributions. Include sample manifest files for testing different source types (git, archive, file)."

### 7. Add Functional Integration Tests
**Prompt:** "Create functional integration tests that build a simple 'Hello World' Flatpak application using flatpak-builder. The test should include a complete manifest file, verify the build process works end-to-end, and validate the resulting Flatpak can be installed and run. Handle cases where system dependencies might be missing."

## Documentation and User Experience

### 8. Create Installation Guide
**Prompt:** "Write a comprehensive installation and setup guide for the flatpak-builder package that covers: 1) Installing system dependencies on major Linux distributions, 2) Setting up the conda environment, 3) Verifying the installation, 4) Troubleshooting common issues, 5) Basic usage examples with sample manifests."

### 9. Add Manifest Examples
**Prompt:** "Create a collection of example Flatpak manifest files demonstrating different use cases: 1) Simple C/C++ application, 2) Python application with pip dependencies, 3) Node.js application with npm dependencies, 4) Application with multiple modules and complex build requirements, 5) Application using git submodules. Include detailed comments explaining each section."

## Alternative Approaches

### 10. System Integration Wrapper
**Prompt:** "Create an alternative approach for flatpak-builder that wraps the system-installed version instead of building from source. Design a conda package that: 1) Detects system-installed flatpak-builder, 2) Creates appropriate wrapper scripts, 3) Validates system dependencies, 4) Provides conda-style activation/deactivation hooks, 5) Maintains compatibility with conda environments."

### 11. Container-Based Solution
**Prompt:** "Design a container-based solution for flatpak-builder that packages all dependencies in a single container image. Create: 1) Dockerfile with all required dependencies, 2) Wrapper scripts to run flatpak-builder in the container, 3) Volume mounting strategy for host filesystem access, 4) Integration with conda environments and build tools."

## Maintenance and Updates

### 12. Version Update Automation
**Prompt:** "Create an automated version update system for the flatpak-builder package that: 1) Monitors the upstream repository for new releases, 2) Automatically updates the recipe with new version numbers and checksums, 3) Runs basic validation tests, 4) Creates pull requests for review, 5) Handles dependency version bumps appropriately."

### 13. Continuous Integration Setup
**Prompt:** "Set up continuous integration for the flatpak-builder package that: 1) Tests builds on multiple Linux distributions, 2) Validates functionality with different dependency versions, 3) Runs security scans on built packages, 4) Performs regression testing with sample applications, 5) Generates build reports and artifacts."

## Advanced Features

### 14. Plugin System Integration
**Prompt:** "Investigate and implement support for flatpak-builder plugins within the conda environment. Research the plugin architecture, identify commonly used plugins, and create recipes for popular plugins like the Node.js, Python, and Rust plugins. Ensure plugins are properly integrated with the main flatpak-builder installation."

### 15. IDE Integration Support
**Prompt:** "Create IDE integration packages for flatpak-builder that provide: 1) VS Code extension for Flatpak manifest editing with syntax highlighting and validation, 2) Build task templates for popular IDEs, 3) Debug configuration helpers, 4) Manifest schema validation and auto-completion, 5) Integration with conda development workflows."

## Priority Order

**High Priority:** Tasks 1-3 (Core Dependencies), Task 4 (Build System), Task 8 (Documentation)
**Medium Priority:** Tasks 5-7 (Testing), Task 10 (System Integration), Task 12 (Updates)  
**Low Priority:** Tasks 9, 11, 13-15 (Advanced Features and Automation)

## Notes

- Each task should be approached iteratively with testing at each step
- System dependency integration is the primary blocker for full functionality
- Consider creating separate feedstocks for each major dependency
- Maintain compatibility with existing conda-forge patterns and conventions
- Document all limitations and workarounds clearly for users
