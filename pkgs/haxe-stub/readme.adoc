= Haxe Stub Package

This package provides a lightweight placeholder for https://haxe.org/[Haxe], the cross-platform programming language toolkit.

== About This Package

*haxe-stub* is a minimal placeholder package that provides basic command-line tools to inform users about the availability of the full Haxe package. This stub allows for immediate installation and testing while the complete Haxe implementation is being developed.

**Current Version**: 4.3.4 +
**Package Size**: ~4.2 KiB +
**Status**: âœ… Successfully deployed to production

== About Haxe

* JavaScript
* C++
* C#
* Java/JVM
* Python
* Lua
* PHP
* Flash
* HashLink VM
* Neko VM

== What's Included

This stub package includes:

* `haxe` - Stub compiler binary with version information
* `haxelib` - Stub library manager binary
* Basic directory structure under `share/haxe/`
* Installation verification tools

== Installation

Add the meso-forge channel and install the package:

[source,bash]
----
# Add the meso-forge channel
conda config --add channels https://prefix.dev/meso-forge

# Install Haxe stub
conda install haxe-stub

# Or install with HashLink stub
conda install haxe-stub hashlink-stub
----

== Usage

After installation, you can verify the stub is working:

[source,bash]
----
# Check Haxe stub version
haxe

# Check Haxelib stub
haxelib
----

The stub binaries will display version information and guidance for installing the full package.

== Architecture Support

Current platform support:
* linux-64

Planned platform support:
* linux-aarch64
* osx-arm64
* osx-64
* win-64
