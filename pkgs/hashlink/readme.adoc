= HashLink Package

This package provides https://hashlink.haxe.org/[HashLink], a virtual machine for Haxe applications.

== About HashLink

HashLink is a cross-platform virtual machine designed to run Haxe applications. It provides:

* High-performance execution of Haxe bytecode
* Just-in-time (JIT) compilation for optimal performance
* Native debugging support
* Cross-platform compatibility (Linux, macOS, Windows)
* Integration with graphics and multimedia libraries

HashLink is often used as an alternative to compiling Haxe to native C++ for applications that need high performance but want to maintain cross-platform compatibility.

== What's Included

This package includes:

* `hl` - The HashLink virtual machine executable
* `libhl` - HashLink runtime library
* Various extension libraries for graphics, audio, and system integration

== Usage

After installation, you can run Haxe applications compiled for HashLink:

[source,bash]
----
# Run a HashLink bytecode file
hl myapp.hl

# Show help
hl --help
----

== Compiling for HashLink

To compile Haxe code for HashLink, you need the Haxe compiler:

[source,bash]
----
# Compile Haxe to HashLink bytecode
haxe --main Main --hl myapp.hl

# Compile Haxe to HashLink/C (for better performance)
haxe --main Main --hl myapp.c
----

== Debugging

HashLink supports native debugging through various IDEs:

* Visual Studio Code (with HashLink debugger extension)
* Other IDEs with HashLink debugging support

== Dependencies

This package includes support for:

* Graphics: SDL2, OpenGL
* Audio: OpenAL
* Image formats: PNG, JPEG
* Networking: libuv
* Database: SQLite
