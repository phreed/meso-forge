= Zed Editor Configuration for Pixi Environments

This directory contains Zed editor configuration for working with Python in your Pixi-managed environments.

== Overview

The configuration enables Zed to use Python interpreters and language servers from specific Pixi environments, providing proper IntelliSense, formatting, and linting support.

== Available Environments

* *default*: Basic environment with Python 3.13 (minimal Python setup)
* *update*: Full Python development environment with Python 3.12, includes:
** Python language servers (Pyright, Ruff)
** Additional Python packages for development
** All version control and development tools

== Quick Start

=== Option 1: Use the Environment Switcher Script

[source,bash]
----
# Switch to update environment (recommended for Python development)
./.zed/switch-env.sh update

# Switch to default environment
./.zed/switch-env.sh default

# Interactive mode - choose from available environments
./.zed/switch-env.sh

# Show current environment
./.zed/switch-env.sh --show
----

=== Option 2: Use Pixi Tasks

[source,bash]
----
# Configure Zed for update environment (with Python tools)
pixi run zed-env-update

# Configure Zed for default environment
pixi run zed-env-default
----

== What Gets Configured

When you switch environments, the
 following settings are updated in `settings.json`:

. *Python Interpreter*: Points to the correct Python binary in the selected environment
. *Language Servers*: Configures Pyright and Ruff to use the environment's binaries
. *Environment Variables*: Sets `PIXI_ENVIRONMENT` and `PYTHONPATH`
. *Terminal*: Configures integrated terminal to use the selected Pixi environment

== Recommended Setup

For Python development, use the *update* environment as it includes:

* Pyright language server for type checking and IntelliSense
* Ruff for fast linting and formatting
* All Python development dependencies

[source,bash]
----
./.zed/switch-env.sh update
----

== Manual Configuration

If you prefer to configure manually, edit `.zed/settings.json` and update:

[source,json]
----
{
  "python": {
    "interpreter": {
      "path": ".pixi/envs/update/bin/python"
    }
  },
  "lsp": {
    "pyright": {
      "binary": {
        "path": ".pixi/envs/update/bin/pyright-langserver",
        "arguments": ["--stdio"]
      },
      "initialization_options": {
        "settings": {
          "python": {
            "pythonPath": ".pixi/envs/update/bin/python",
            "venvPath": ".pixi/envs",
            "defaultInterpreterPath": ".pixi/envs/update/bin/python"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "env": {
    "PIXI_ENVIRONMENT": "update"
  }
}
----

== Troubleshooting

=== Language Servers Not Working

If Pyright or Ruff aren't working:

. Ensure they're installed in your environment:
+
[source,bash]
----
pixi list -e update | grep -E "(pyright|ruff)"
----

. If missing, they should be added automatically. If not:
+
[source,bash]
----
pixi add -e update pyright ruff
----

=== Python Path Issues

If Python modules aren't being found:

. Check that the correct environment is selected:
+
[source,bash]
----
./.zed/switch-env.sh --show
----

. Restart Zed after switching environments

. Check that the Python path is correct:
+
[source,bash]
----
ls -la .pixi/envs/update/bin/python
----

=== Settings Not Persisting

* The script creates backups of your settings in `.zed/settings.json.backup.*`
* Check file permissions on `.zed/settings.json`
* Ensure you're running the script from the project root

== Files

* `settings.json`: Main Zed configuration file
* `switch-env.sh`: Script to switch between Pixi environments
* `aliases.sh`: Convenient shell aliases
* `README.adoc`: This documentation

== Environment Details

=== Default Environment
* Python 3.13
* Basic system tools
* Minimal dependencies
* Good for general scripting

=== Update Environment
* Python 3.12
* Pyright language server
* Ruff linter/formatter
* Development tools (requests, pyyaml, etc.)
* Version control utilities
* Recommended for Python development

== Adding New Environments

To add support for a new Pixi environment:

. Add it to the `ENVIRONMENTS` array in `switch-env.sh`
. Update the `pixi.toml` to include necessary language servers
. Test the configuration

== Support

If you encounter issues:

. Check that Pixi environments are properly installed: `pixi info`
. Verify language servers are available: `pixi list -e update`
. Check Zed's language server logs in the editor
. Restart Zed after making configuration changes
