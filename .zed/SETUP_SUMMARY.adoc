:toc: left
:toclevels: 3

== Configuration Complete ✅

Your Zed editor has been successfully configured to work with Pixi Python environments!

== What Was Changed

=== 1. Dependencies Added to `pixi.toml`

Added Python language servers to the `version-ctl` feature:

[source,toml]
----
[feature.version-ctl.dependencies]
# ... existing dependencies ...
# Language servers for Zed editor
pyright = ">=1.1.402,<1.2.0"
ruff = ">=0.12.0,<=0.13.0"
----

=== 2. Pixi Tasks Added

Two new tasks for environment switching:

[source,toml]
----
[tasks.zed-env-default]
description = "Configure Zed to use default pixi environment"

[tasks.zed-env-update]
description = "Configure Zed to use update pixi environment (with Python tools)"
----

=== 3. Zed Configuration Files Created

[cols="1,2,3"]
|===
|File |Purpose |Description

|`settings.json`
|Main Zed configuration
|Configures Python interpreter, language servers (Pyright, Ruff), terminal, and environment variables

|`switch-env.sh`
|Environment switcher script
|Interactive script to switch between Pixi environments with automatic configuration

|`aliases.sh`
|Shell convenience aliases
|Provides quick commands like `zed-py` and `zed-basic` for environment switching

|`README.adoc`
|Documentation
|Comprehensive guide for using the Zed + Pixi integration
|===

== Quick Start Commands

=== Recommended: Python Development Environment

[source,bash]
----
# Switch to full Python development environment
./.zed/switch-env.sh update

# OR using aliases (after sourcing)
source .zed/aliases.sh
zed-py
----

=== Alternative: Basic Environment

[source,bash]
----
# Switch to basic environment
./.zed/switch-env.sh default

# OR using aliases
zed-basic
----

|===

== Current Status

After running the configuration:

* ✅ Language servers installed in `update` environment
* ✅ Zed settings configured for Python development
* ✅ Environment switcher scripts ready
* ✅ Shell aliases available
* ✅ Documentation complete

== Verification Steps

=== 1. Check Environment Status

[source,bash]
----
./.zed/switch-env.sh --show
----

Expected output:
----
Current environment: update
Python path: .pixi/envs/update/bin/python
----

=== 2. Verify Language Servers

[source,bash]
----
ls -la .pixi/envs/update/bin/ | grep -E "(pyright|ruff)"
----

Should show both `pyright-langserver` and `ruff` executables.

=== 3. Test in Zed

. Open Zed editor
. Create or open a Python file
. Verify:
   * IntelliSense suggestions appear
   * Type hints work
   * Automatic formatting on save
   * Error highlighting for Python issues

== Next Steps

=== 1. Load Aliases (Optional but Recommended)

Add to your shell configuration file (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.):

[source,bash]
----
# Add this line to automatically load Zed aliases
source /path/to/meso-forge/.zed/aliases.sh
----

=== 2. Restart Zed

For best results, restart Zed editor after environment changes.

=== 3. Start Developing

You're ready to develop Python code with full IDE features:

* Code completion
* Type checking
* Error detection
* Automatic formatting
* Import organization

== Troubleshooting

=== Common Issues

[cols="2,3"]
|===
|Issue |Solution

|Language servers not working
|Run `pixi install -e update` to reinstall environment

|Python imports not found
|Verify environment with `./.zed/switch-env.sh --show`

|Settings not updating
|Check file permissions on `.zed/settings.json`

|Need to reset configuration
|Restore from backup: `cp .zed/settings.json.backup.* .zed/settings.json`
|===

=== Getting Help

. Check the comprehensive documentation: `README.adoc`
. Verify Pixi setup: `pixi info`
. Check language server availability: `pixi list -e update`
. Review Zed's language server logs in the editor

== Summary

🎉 *Success!* Your Zed editor now has full Python IDE capabilities using your Pixi-managed environments. The `update` environment provides the best Python development experience with Pyright and Ruff integration.

Use `zed-py` (after sourcing aliases) or `./.zed/switch-env.sh update` to ensure you're in the Python development environment, then enjoy coding with full language support!
