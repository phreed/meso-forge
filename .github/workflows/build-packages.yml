name: Build packages (CI)

# This workflow builds conda packages for multiple platforms
#
# Trigger Strategy:
# - Manual execution: Always available via workflow_dispatch
# - Automatic execution: Only when pushing to or creating PR against the 'build' branch
# - The 'build' branch should be used for changes that are ready to build packages
# - Use 'packages' or other branches for development work that shouldn't trigger builds

# this is important for trusted publishing
