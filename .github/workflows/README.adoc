= GitHub Workflows Documentation

This directory contains the GitHub Actions workflows for building and publishing packages in the meso-forge repository.

== Workflow Overview

The package build and publish process uses two separate workflows with controlled trigger strategies to minimize unnecessary runs and provide better control over when packages are built and published.

== Workflows

=== 1. Build Packages (CI) - `build-packages.yml`

*Purpose*: Builds conda packages for multiple platforms and creates artifacts.

*Trigger Strategy*:
* ✅ *Manual execution*: Always available via `workflow_dispatch`
* ✅ *Automatic execution*: Only when pushing to or creating PR against the `build` branch
* ❌ *No longer runs on*: `packages` branch or other development branches

*What it does*:
* Sets up the build environment with Pixi
* Builds platform-specific packages using `pixi run build-for-platform`
* Uploads built packages as GitHub artifacts (excludes files with colons to avoid upload errors)
* Provides build status summary across all platforms

*Platforms Supported*:
* `linux-64` (x86_64)
* `linux-aarch64` (ARM64)

*Artifacts Created*:
* `packages-linux-64` - Contains all `.conda` files for linux-64
* `packages-linux-aarch64` - Contains all `.conda` files for linux-aarch64

=== 2. Publish Packages (CI) - `publish-packages.yml`

*Purpose*: Downloads build artifacts and publishes packages to repositories.

*Trigger Strategy*:
* ✅ *Manual execution*: Primary method - requires `run_id` parameter
* ✅ *Push to publish branch*: Triggers workflow but requires manual re-run with `run_id`
* ❌ *No longer runs automatically*: After build completion

*What it does*:
* Downloads artifacts from specified build workflow run
* Sets up the publish environment with Pixi
* Publishes packages using `pixi run publish-pd`
* Provides publish status summary

*Required Input*:
* `run_id`: The workflow run ID from a successful build to download artifacts from

== Branch Strategy

=== Development Flow

[source]
----
packages (main development)
    ↓ (development work)
    ↓ (when ready to build)
build (triggers package builds)
    ↓ (when ready to publish)
publish (signals readiness to publish - requires manual trigger with run_id)
----

=== Branch Usage

*`packages` branch*:
* Main development branch
* Use for ongoing development work
* Does NOT trigger builds automatically
* Safe for experimental changes

*`build` branch*:
* Use when packages are ready to be built
* Push or PR to this branch triggers the build workflow
* Should contain stable, tested package definitions

*`publish` branch*:
* Use to signal readiness to publish packages
* Push to this branch requires manual workflow execution with `run_id`
* Provides a clear audit trail of publication intentions

== Usage Examples

=== Building Packages

==== Method 1: Manual Trigger
[source,bash]
----
# Via GitHub CLI
gh workflow run build-packages.yml

# Via GitHub Web UI
# Navigate to Actions → Build packages (CI) → Run workflow
----

==== Method 2: Push to Build Branch
[source,bash]
----
# Switch to build branch and push changes
git checkout build
git merge packages  # or cherry-pick specific commits
git push origin build
----

=== Publishing Packages

==== Method 1: Manual Trigger (Recommended)
[source,bash]
----
# Get the run ID from a successful build
BUILD_RUN_ID=$(gh run list --workflow=build-packages.yml --status=success --limit=1 --json=databaseId --jq='.[0].databaseId')

# Trigger publish with the build run ID
gh workflow run publish-packages.yml -f run_id=$BUILD_RUN_ID
----

==== Method 2: Push to Publish Branch
[source,bash]
----
# Push to publish branch (will require manual re-run)
git checkout publish
git merge build  # or specific commits
git push origin publish

# Then manually trigger the failed workflow with run_id
gh workflow run publish-packages.yml -f run_id=<BUILD_RUN_ID>
----

== Benefits of This Strategy

✅ *Controlled Builds*: Builds only happen when explicitly requested or on dedicated branch +
✅ *No Accidental Runs*: Development work on `packages` branch doesn't trigger CI +
✅ *Clear Intent*: Branch names clearly indicate the purpose (`build`, `publish`) +
✅ *Manual Override*: Can always manually trigger workflows when needed +
✅ *Artifact Management*: Built packages are stored as GitHub artifacts for 30 days +
✅ *Flexible Publishing*: Can publish from any successful build using `run_id` +
✅ *Resource Efficiency*: Reduces unnecessary workflow runs and associated costs

== Required Secrets

The workflows require the following secrets to be configured in the repository:

* `PREFIX_DEV_TOKEN`: Authentication token for prefix.dev publishing
* `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Automatically provided by GitHub for artifact operations

== Troubleshooting

=== Build Issues

*Colon in Filename Error*:
[source]
----
Error: The path for one of the files in artifact is not valid:
/path/to/App::Cpan.3. Contains the following character: Colon :
----

*Solution*: The build workflow now excludes files with colons using the pattern `!**/*:*`

*Platform-Specific Failures*:
* Check if the issue is specific to `linux-aarch64` (cross-compilation)
* Verify dependencies are available for the target platform
* Review rattler-build logs for compilation errors

=== Publish Issues

*Missing Artifacts*:
[source]
----
Error: Artifact 'packages-linux-64' not found
----

*Solutions*:
* Verify the `run_id` corresponds to a successful build workflow
* Check that the build workflow completed successfully
* Ensure artifacts haven't expired (30-day retention)

*Authentication Errors*:
* Verify `PREFIX_DEV_TOKEN` is configured and valid
* Check token permissions for the target repository

=== General Workflow Issues

*Workflow Not Triggering*:
* Confirm you're pushing to the correct branch (`build` or `publish`)
* Check workflow file syntax with `gh workflow list`
* Verify branch protection rules aren't blocking the trigger

*Manual Trigger Not Available*:
* Ensure you have write access to the repository
* Check that the workflow file is on the default branch
* Verify `workflow_dispatch` is properly configured

== Best Practices

. *Use Manual Triggers*: For maximum control, prefer manual workflow execution
. *Test Before Building*: Thoroughly test package changes before pushing to `build` branch
. *Monitor Build Logs*: Always check build output for warnings or issues
. *Verify Artifacts*: Confirm all expected packages are built before publishing
. *Document Run IDs*: Keep track of successful build run IDs for publishing
. *Branch Hygiene*: Keep `build` and `publish` branches clean and purpose-specific
. *Artifact Lifecycle*: Remember that artifacts expire after 30 days
. *Security*: Never commit secrets or tokens to the repository

== Migration Notes

*From Previous Workflow*:
* The old `packages` branch trigger has been moved to `build` branch
* Publishing now requires explicit run ID specification
* Workflows are now fully independent and can be run separately
* Artifact exclusion patterns have been added to handle problematic filenames

*Action Required*:
* Update any automation that relies on the old trigger patterns
* Create `build` and `publish` branches if they don't exist
* Update team workflows to use the new branch strategy
