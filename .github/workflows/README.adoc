= GitHub Workflows Documentation

This directory contains the GitHub Actions workflows for building and publishing packages in the meso-forge repository.

== Workflow Overview

The package build and publish process uses separate workflows with controlled trigger strategies 
to minimize unnecessary runs and provide better control over when packages are built and published.

== Workflows

=== 1. Build Packages (CI) - `build-packages.yml`

*Purpose*: Builds conda packages for multiple platforms and creates artifacts.

*Trigger Strategy*:

* ‚úÖ *Manual execution*: Always available via `workflow_dispatch`
* ‚úÖ *Automatic execution*: Only when pushing to or creating PR against the `build` branch
* ‚ùå *Does not run automatically on development branches*

*What it does*:

* Sets up the build environment with Pixi
* Builds platform-specific packages using `pixi run build-for-platform`
* Uploads built packages as GitHub artifacts (excludes files with colons to avoid upload errors)
* Provides build status summary across all platforms

*Platforms Supported*:

* `linux-64` (x86_64)
* `linux-aarch64` (ARM64)

*Artifacts Created*:

* `packages-linux-64` - Contains all `.conda` files for linux-64
* `packages-linux-aarch64` - Contains all `.conda` files for linux-aarch64

=== 2. Publish Packages (CI) - `publish-packages.yml`

*Purpose*: Downloads build artifacts and publishes packages to repositories.

*Trigger Strategy*:

* ‚úÖ *Manual execution*: Primary method - requires `run_id` parameter
* ‚úÖ *Push to publish branch*: Triggers workflow but requires manual re-run with `run_id`
* ‚ùå *No longer runs automatically*: After build completion

*What it does*:

* Downloads artifacts from specified build workflow run
* Sets up the publish environment with Pixi
* Publishes packages using `pixi run publish-pd`
* Provides publish status summary

*Required Input*:

* `run_id`: The workflow run ID from a successful build to download artifacts from

=== 3. Build and Publish Single Package - `build-publish-package.yml`

*Purpose*: Builds and publishes a specific package in a single workflow run.

*Trigger Strategy*:

* ‚úÖ *Manual execution only*: Always requires `workflow_dispatch` with package name
* ‚ùå *No automatic triggers*: Must be manually requested every time
* üéØ *Single package focus*: Builds and publishes only the specified package

*What it does*:

* Validates the specified package exists and has a valid recipe
* Builds the package for the specified platform (default: linux-64)
* Validates the built package structure
* Optionally publishes the package (can be skipped with `skip_publish`)
* Provides comprehensive logging and error reporting

*Required Inputs*:

* `package_name`: Name of the package to build (e.g., "fsarchiver", "doctl")

*Optional Inputs*:

* `target_platform`: Build platform (linux-64, linux-aarch64)
* `skip_publish`: Build only, skip publishing step
* `force_build`: Force rebuild even if package exists

*Use Cases*:

* Quick iteration on a single package
* Hotfixes for specific packages
* Testing package builds without full CI run
* Publishing urgent updates without waiting for full builds

== Branch Strategy

=== Development Flow

[source]
----
    ‚Üì (development work)
packages (main development)
    ‚Üì (when ready to build)
build (triggers package builds)
    ‚Üì (when ready to publish)
publish (signals readiness to publish - requires manual trigger with run_id)
----

=== Branch Usage

*`packages` branch*:

* Main development branch
* Use for ongoing development work
* Does NOT trigger builds automatically
* Safe for experimental changes

*`build` branch*:

* Use when packages are ready to be built
* Push or PR to this branch triggers the build workflow
* Should contain stable, tested package definitions

*`publish` branch*:

* Use to signal readiness to publish packages
* Push to this branch requires manual workflow execution with `run_id`
* Provides a clear audit trail of publication intentions

== Usage Examples

=== Building Packages

==== Method 1: Manual Trigger

Via GitHub CLI
[source,bash]
----
gh workflow run build-packages.yml
----

Via GitHub Web UI

* Navigate to Actions ‚Üí Build packages (CI) ‚Üí Run workflow

==== Method 2: Push to Build Branch

Switch to build branch and push changes
[source,bash]
----
git checkout build
git merge packages  # or cherry-pick specific commits
git push origin build
----

=== Publishing Packages

==== Method 1: Manual Trigger (Recommended)

===== Command Line

Get the run ID from a successful build.
[source,bash]
----
gh run list --workflow=build-packages.yml --status=success

BUILD_RUN_ID=$(gh run list --workflow=build-packages.yml --status=success --limit=1 --json=databaseId --jq='.[0].databaseId')
----

Trigger publish with the build run ID
[source,bash]
----
gh workflow run publish-packages.yml -f run_id=$BUILD_RUN_ID
----

===== GitHub Web UI

* Navigate to Actions ‚Üí Build packages (CI) ‚Üí Run workflow

You may provide the `run_id` parameter.
If you do not provide the `run_id` parameter, it will try to find a successful build for the `build` branch.

==== Method 2: Push to Publish Branch

Push to publish branch (will require manual re-run)
[source,bash]
----
git checkout publish
git merge build  # or specific commits
git push origin publish
----

Then manually trigger the failed workflow with run_id
[source,bash]
----
gh workflow run publish-packages.yml -f run_id=<BUILD_RUN_ID>
----

== Benefits of This Strategy

‚úÖ *Controlled Builds*: Builds only happen when explicitly requested or on dedicated branch +
‚úÖ *No Accidental Runs*: Development work on `packages` branch doesn't trigger CI +
‚úÖ *Clear Intent*: Branch names clearly indicate the purpose (`build`, `publish`) +
‚úÖ *Manual Override*: Can always manually trigger workflows when needed +
‚úÖ *Artifact Management*: Built packages are stored as GitHub artifacts for 30 days +
‚úÖ *Flexible Publishing*: Can publish from any successful build using `run_id` +
‚úÖ *Resource Efficiency*: Reduces unnecessary workflow runs and associated costs

== Required Secrets

The workflows require the following secrets to be configured in the repository:

* `PREFIX_DEV_TOKEN`: Authentication token for prefix.dev publishing
* `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Automatically provided by GitHub for artifact operations

== Troubleshooting

=== Build Issues

==== Colon in Filename Error

[source]
----
Error: The path for one of the files in artifact is not valid:
/path/to/App::Cpan.3. Contains the following character: Colon :
----

*Solution*: The build workflow excludes files with colons using the pattern `!**/*:*`

=== Publish Issues

===== Missing Artifacts

[source]
----
Error: Artifact 'packages-linux-64' not found
----
*Solutions*:

* Verify the `run_id` corresponds to a successful build workflow
* Check that the build workflow completed successfully
* Ensure artifacts haven't expired (30-day retention)

===== Authentication Errors

* Verify `PREFIX_DEV_TOKEN` is configured and valid
* Check token permissions for the target repository

=== General Workflow Issues

===== Workflow Not Triggering

* Confirm you're pushing to the correct branch (`build` or `publish`)
* Check workflow file syntax with `gh workflow list`
* Verify branch protection rules aren't blocking the trigger

==== Manual Trigger Not Available

* Ensure you have write access to the repository
* Check that the workflow file is on the default branch
* Verify `workflow_dispatch` is properly configured

== Best Practices

Use Manual Triggers:: For maximum control, prefer manual workflow execution
Test Before Building:: Thoroughly test package changes before pushing to `build` branch
Monitor Build Logs:: Always check build output for warnings or issues
Verify Artifacts:: Confirm all expected packages are built before publishing
Document Run IDs:: Keep track of successful build run IDs for publishing
Branch Hygiene:: Keep `build` and `publish` branches clean and purpose-specific
Artifact Lifecycle:: Remember that artifacts expire after 30 days
Security:: Never commit secrets or tokens to the repository
