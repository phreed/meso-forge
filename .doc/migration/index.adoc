This documentation guides the migration from a monolithic meso-forge repository to a domain-based branch structure with centralized tooling.

== Overview

The meso-forge project is evolving from a single repository containing all packages to a more scalable architecture with:

* *Centralized Tooling:* `meso-forge-tooling` conda package providing build infrastructure
* *Domain-Based Branches:* Separate branches for different package categories
* *Consistent Interface:* Unified commands across all domains

== Migration Documents

=== Planning Documents

link:domain-groups.adoc[Domain Groups^]::
Detailed breakdown of the 7 domain groups and their respective packages. Explains the rationale for grouping and the benefits of domain-based organization.

=== Implementation Guides

link:migration-guide.adoc[Migration Guide^]::
Step-by-step instructions for executing the migration from monolithic to domain-based structure. Includes commands, templates, and verification steps.

=== Status Reports

link:tooling-complete.adoc[Tooling Complete^]::
Comprehensive status report on the completed `meso-forge-tooling` package. Details what's included, installation instructions, and readiness for migration.

link:tooling-verified.adoc[Tooling Verified^]::
Final verification summary of the tooling package with dependency corrections and production readiness confirmation.

link:quick-reference.adoc[Quick Reference^]::
Command reference and common workflows for the meso-forge tooling package.

== Quick Start

=== For Repository Maintainers

. Review the link:domain-groups.adoc[domain groups] to understand the new organization
. Follow the link:migration-guide.adoc[migration guide] to create domain branches
. Use the link:quick-reference.adoc[quick reference] for daily tooling commands
. Use the tooling package to maintain consistent build processes

=== For Package Contributors

. Install the tooling: `pixi global install "meso-forge-tooling=0.1.1" -c https://prefix.dev/meso-forge`
. Reference the link:quick-reference.adoc[quick reference] for commands
. Work within your domain branch
. Use `meso-forge build-all` and `meso-forge publish` commands

=== For Package Users

. Packages will remain available from the same channels
. Installation commands remain unchanged
. Domain organization improves package discovery

* Smaller, focused repositories
* Domain-specific expertise
* Independent release cycles

=== Maintainability
* Clear ownership boundaries
* Reduced complexity per branch
* Easier onboarding for new contributors

=== User Experience
* Better package discovery
* Domain-specific documentation
* Targeted installation options

== Architecture

=== Current (Monolithic)
