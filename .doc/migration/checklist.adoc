This checklist tracks the progress of migrating meso-forge from monolithic to domain-based structure.

== Pre-Migration Setup

=== Tooling Package
* [x] Build meso-forge-tooling package
* [x] Fix nushell dependency (v0.1.1)
* [x] Publish to meso-forge channel
* [x] Verify installation works
* [x] Test all commands functional

=== Planning and Documentation
* [x] Define domain groups (7 domains)
* [x] Categorize all 32 packages
* [x] Create migration guide
* [x] Create package branch templates
* [x] Convert documentation to AsciiDoc

== Phase 1: Pilot Domain (tactical-packages)

=== Branch Creation
* [ ] Create `packages/tactical` orphan branch
* [ ] Remove non-tactical packages
* [ ] Add template pixi.toml
* [ ] Create domain-specific README
* [ ] Commit and push branch

=== Verification
* [ ] Install meso-forge-tooling on branch
* [ ] Test `pixi run build-all`
* [ ] Test `pixi run publish`
* [ ] Verify packages still installable
* [ ] Document any issues

== Phase 2: Core Domains

=== system-tools Branch
* [ ] Create `packages/system-tools` branch
* [ ] Copy system tool packages (7 packages)
* [ ] Configure pixi.toml
* [ ] Test build process
* [ ] Verify publishing

=== development-tools Branch
* [ ] Create `packages/development-tools` branch
* [ ] Copy development packages (6 packages)
* [ ] Configure pixi.toml
* [ ] Test build process
* [ ] Verify publishing

=== documentation-tools Branch
* [ ] Create `packages/documentation-tools` branch
* [ ] Copy documentation package (1 package)
* [ ] Configure pixi.toml
* [ ] Test build process
* [ ] Verify publishing

== Phase 3: Remaining Domains

=== cloud-infrastructure Branch
* [ ] Create `packages/cloud-infrastructure` branch
* [ ] Copy cloud packages (4 packages)
* [ ] Configure pixi.toml
* [ ] Test build process
* [ ] Verify publishing

=== communication-media Branch
* [ ] Create `packages/communication-media` branch
* [ ] Copy communication packages (5 packages)
* [ ] Configure pixi.toml
* [ ] Test build process
* [ ] Verify publishing

=== data-processing Branch
* [ ] Create `packages/data-processing` branch
* [ ] Copy data processing packages (4 packages)
* [ ] Configure pixi.toml
* [ ] Test build process
* [ ] Verify publishing

== Phase 4: Infrastructure Updates

=== CI/CD Configuration
* [ ] Create multi-branch GitHub Actions
* [ ] Update build workflows for domains
* [ ] Test automated builds
* [ ] Update publishing workflows
* [ ] Test automated publishing

=== Main Branch Cleanup
* [ ] Remove package directories from main
* [ ] Keep only meso-forge-tooling package
* [ ] Update main README.adoc
* [ ] Archive migration documentation
* [ ] Update repository description

== Phase 5: Validation and Go-Live

=== Cross-Domain Testing
* [ ] Test all 7 domain branches build successfully
* [ ] Verify package publishing works
* [ ] Test package installation from all domains
* [ ] Verify no package conflicts
* [ ] Test CI/CD pipelines

=== Documentation and Training
* [ ] Update README files for all branches
* [ ] Create contributor guidelines per domain
* [ ] Update project documentation
* [ ] Announce migration completion
* [ ] Train team on new workflow

=== Quality Assurance
* [ ] All packages still installable
* [ ] No broken dependencies
* [ ] All CI/CD pipelines functional
* [ ] Documentation complete and accurate
* [ ] Team comfortable with new workflow

== Post-Migration Tasks

=== Optimization
* [ ] Monitor build times per domain
* [ ] Optimize CI/CD resource usage
* [ ] Collect feedback from contributors
* [ ] Refine domain boundaries if needed
* [ ] Update tooling based on usage

=== Maintenance
* [ ] Set up regular tooling updates
* [ ] Establish domain ownership
* [ ] Create contribution guidelines
* [ ] Plan for new package onboarding
* [ ] Monitor package growth per domain

== Success Criteria

* [ ] All 32 packages successfully migrated
* [ ] All packages remain installable
* [ ] Build times improved or maintained
* [ ] Contributors comfortable with new structure
* [ ] Clear domain ownership established
* [ ] Documentation complete and up-to-date
* [ ] CI/CD fully functional across all branches
* [ ] Rollback plan tested and documented

== Rollback Criteria

If any of these occur, consider rollback:
* [ ] Critical packages become unbuildable
* [ ] Significant contributor workflow disruption
* [ ] CI/CD failures that can't be quickly resolved
* [ ] Major dependency resolution issues
* [ ] Team productivity significantly impacted
