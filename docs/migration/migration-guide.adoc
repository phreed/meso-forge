This guide outlines the step-by-step process for migrating from the current monolithic meso-forge repository to a domain-based branch structure with tooling as a separate conda package.

== Overview

We are transitioning from:

* *Current:* Single repository with all packages and tooling
* *Target:* Tooling as conda package + domain-specific branches

== Migration Steps

=== Phase 1: Create and Test Tooling Package

==== 1.1 Build the meso-forge-tooling package

[source,bash]
----
cd meso-forge
pixi run build-pkg meso-forge-tooling
----

==== 1.2 Publish the tooling package

[source,bash]
----
pixi run publish-pd
----

==== 1.3 Test tooling installation

[source,bash]
----
# Install the tooling globally
pixi global install meso-forge-tooling -c https://prefix.dev/meso-forge -c conda-forge

# Verify installation
meso-forge help
----

=== Phase 2: Merge Packages Branch into Main

Before creating domain branches, we need to merge the `packages` branch into `main` to get all packages in one place.

[source,bash]
----
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Merge packages branch to get all packages
git merge packages

# Verify all packages are present
ls pkgs/

# Push updated main branch
git push origin main
----

==== 3.4 Create remaining domain branches

Repeat the process for:

* `pkgs/cloud-infrastructure`
* `pkgs/communication-media`
* `pkgs/data-processing`

=== Phase 5: Update CI/CD

==== 5.1 Create GitHub Actions for branches

Create `.github/workflows/build-packages.yml`:

[source,yaml]
----
name: Build Packages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - 'pkgs/**'
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - 'pkgs/**'

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        branch: [tactical, system-tools, development-tools, documentation-tools, cloud-infrastructure, communication-media, data-processing]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      with:
        ref: pkgs/${{ matrix.branch }}

    - name: Install pixi
      uses: prefix-dev/setup-pixi@v0.8.1

    - name: Install meso-forge-tooling
      run: pixi global install meso-forge-tooling -c https://prefix.dev/meso-forge

    - name: Build packages
      run: pixi run build-all

    - name: Test packages
      run: pixi run test
----

==== 5.2 Update tooling CI

Create `.github/workflows/build-tooling.yml`:

[source,yaml]
----
name: Build Tooling

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
    paths: ['pkgs/meso-forge-tooling/**']

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Install pixi
      uses: prefix-dev/setup-pixi@v0.8.1
    - name: Build tooling
      run: pixi run build-pkg meso-forge-tooling
    - name: Publish tooling
      run: pixi run publish-pd
      env:
        RATTLER_AUTH_FILE: ${{ secrets.RATTLER_AUTH_FILE }}
----

=== Phase 6: Validation and Testing

==== 6.1 Test each branch independently

[source,bash]
----
# For each package branch
git checkout pkgs/tactical
pixi global install meso-forge-tooling -c https://prefix.dev/meso-forge
pixi run build-all
pixi run test
----

==== 6.2 Verify package publishing

[source,bash]
----
# Test that packages can still be found
pixi search freetakserver -c https://prefix.dev/meso-forge
pixi search rotz -c https://prefix.dev/meso-forge
----

==== 6.3 Test new package creation

[source,bash]
----
# In a package branch
pixi run new-package _skeleton_rust my-new-tool
# Then commit the new package
git add pkgs/my-new-tool/
git commit -m "Add new package: my-new-tool"
----

== Post-Migration Benefits

=== For Maintainers

* *Domain Focus:* Work on packages in your area of expertise
* *Reduced Complexity:* Fewer packages per branch
* *Independent Releases:* Release domains at different cadences
* *Clear Ownership:* Domain teams own their branches

=== For Users

* *Easier Discovery:* Find packages by domain
* *Targeted Installation:* Install only relevant package categories
* *Better Documentation:* Domain-specific documentation

=== For CI/CD

* *Faster Builds:* Only build changed domains
* *Parallel Processing:* Build domains in parallel
* *Targeted Testing:* Test only relevant packages

== Rollback Plan

If issues arise, rollback is possible:

. *Immediate:* Revert to main branch for urgent fixes
. *Partial:* Cherry-pick fixes from domain branches to main
. *Full:* Merge all domain branches back to main

== Success Criteria

* [ ] meso-forge-tooling package builds and installs
* [ ] All domain branches build successfully
* [ ] Existing packages still installable
* [ ] CI/CD works for all branches
* [ ] Documentation updated
* [ ] Team training completed
