= C++ Meson Package Recipe Template
:toc:
:toc-placement: preamble

This skeleton provides a template for packaging C++ projects that use the Meson build system in conda-forge style packages. It incorporates best practices learned from packaging complex projects like GTK/GNOME libraries.

== When to Use This Template

Use this template when:

* Your C++ project uses Meson as its build system
* You're packaging GTK/GNOME libraries or applications
* You need cross-platform compatibility (Linux, macOS, Windows)
* Your project has complex dependency chains
* You want consistent library placement across different environments

== Key Features

=== Cross-Platform Build System
* Explicit `--libdir=lib64` configuration for consistent library placement
* Proper PKG_CONFIG_PATH setup for dependency detection
* Windows-compatible path handling with `Library/` prefix
* Flexible file patterns using `lib*/` for cross-platform testing

=== Robust Dependency Management
* Comprehensive PKG_CONFIG_PATH configuration
* Support for complex GTK/GNOME dependency chains
* Careful handling of problematic features (introspection, vapi)
* Build vs host vs run dependency separation

=== Reliable Testing
* Package contents verification with flexible patterns
* Cross-platform compatible file path matching
* Simple smoke tests that avoid environment setup issues
* Focus on essential functionality verification

== Usage Instructions

=== 1. Copy and Customize

Copy this skeleton to your package directory and customize the context variables:

[source,yaml]
----
context:
  name: your-package-name
  version: "1.0.0"
  github_org: your-github-org
  github_repo: your-repo-name
  library_name: your-lib-name
  library_version: "1"
----

=== 2. Update Source Information

Modify the source section with your project's URL and checksum:

[source,yaml]
----
source:
  url: https://github.com/your-org/your-repo/archive/refs/tags/v{{ version }}.tar.gz
  sha256: "your-actual-sha256-checksum-here"
----

=== 3. Configure Build Options

Customize meson configuration options for your project:

[source,bash]
----
^meson setup build \
  --prefix=$PREFIX \
  --libdir=lib64 \
  --buildtype=release \
  --wrap-mode=nofallback \
  -Dintrospection=disabled \
  -Dvapi=false \
  -Ddocs=false
----

=== 4. Set Dependencies

Update the requirements sections:

* **build**: Compilers, meson, ninja, pkg-config tools
* **host**: Development libraries your project depends on
* **run**: Runtime libraries (usually auto-detected)

=== 5. Configure Tests

Update the package_contents test with your expected files:

[source,yaml]
----
tests:
  - package_contents:
      files:
        - lib*/libyourlib.so*
        - include/yourlib/yourlib.h
        - lib*/pkgconfig/yourlib.pc
----

== Best Practices

=== Build System Configuration

==== Always Use Explicit libdir
[source,bash]
----
--libdir=lib64
----
This ensures consistent library placement across different Linux distributions and environments.

==== Set PKG_CONFIG_PATH Comprehensively
[source,bash]
----
PKG_CONFIG_PATH = \
  $BUILD_PREFIX/lib/pkgconfig:$PREFIX/lib/pkgconfig:\
  $BUILD_PREFIX/lib64/pkgconfig:$PREFIX/lib64/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH
----

==== Disable Problematic Features
For complex projects like GTK libraries, disable features that can cause dependency conflicts:

[source,bash]
----
-Dintrospection=disabled
-Dvapi=false
-Dsysprof=false
----

=== Cross-Platform Compatibility

==== Use Flexible File Patterns
Instead of hardcoded paths:
[source,yaml]
----
# ❌ Don't do this
- lib64/libname.so*

# ✅ Do this
- lib*/libname.so*
----

==== Handle Windows Paths
[source,yaml]
----
- ${{ "Library/" if win }}lib*/libname${{ ".dll" if win else ".so*" }}
----

=== Testing Strategy

==== Focus on Package Contents
Package contents tests are more reliable than complex script tests:

[source,yaml]
----
tests:
  - package_contents:
      files:
        - lib*/libname.so*
        - include/name/name.h
        - lib*/pkgconfig/name.pc
----

==== Keep Script Tests Simple
If you need script tests, keep them minimal:

[source,yaml]
----
script:
  content: |
    # Simple smoke test
    ^pkg-config --exists yourlib
    echo "✓ Basic integration works"
----

== Common Customizations

=== GTK/GNOME Applications
For GTK applications, add typical dependencies:

[source,yaml]
----
host:
  - glib
  - libglib
  - gtk4  # or gtk3
  - cairo
  - pango
  - gdk-pixbuf
----

=== Library with Headers
For libraries, test both library and header files:

[source,yaml]
----
tests:
  - package_contents:
      files:
        - lib*/libname.so*
        - include/name/name.h
        - lib*/pkgconfig/name.pc
----

=== GUI Application
For GUI applications, include desktop files and icons:

[source,yaml]
----
tests:
  - package_contents:
      files:
        - bin/appname
        - share/applications/appname.desktop
        - share/icons/hicolor/*/apps/appname.png
----

== Troubleshooting

=== Build Fails to Find Dependencies
1. Check PKG_CONFIG_PATH includes both lib and lib64
2. Verify dependencies are in host requirements
3. Use `pkgconf --debug` to diagnose pkg-config issues

=== Library Files Not Found in Tests
1. Check if files are in lib/ vs lib64/
2. Use `lib*/` pattern instead of hardcoded paths
3. Verify meson is using `--libdir=lib64`

=== Complex Dependency Conflicts
1. Disable problematic features (introspection, vapi)
2. Use package_contents tests instead of script tests
3. Simplify the dependency chain

== Examples

This template is based on successful packaging of projects like:

* GTKSourceView5 - Text editor widget library
* Various GNOME applications and libraries
* Cross-platform C++ libraries with meson

== Related Templates

* `_skeleton_cxx_appl` - For CMake-based C++ applications
* `_skeleton_cxx_hdr` - For header-only C++ libraries
* `_skeleton_python` - For Python packages

== Contributing

When contributing improvements to this template:

1. Test changes across multiple platforms
2. Verify compatibility with various meson project structures
3. Update documentation with new best practices
4. Consider backward compatibility with existing recipes
